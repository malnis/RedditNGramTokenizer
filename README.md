# RedditNGramTokenizer

This java program reads each line of the Reddit generated comment files (from this project ...) and tokenizes them into 1-5 grams. There are two version: serial and multi-threaded computing. As the multi-threaded version needs at least 6-8 TB RAM to process each file so I run the program in serial mode in default (which requires 2TB RAM). An example to process a monthly file in Hungabee (https://www.westgrid.ca/support/quickstart/hungabee) and requests 2TB RAM.
